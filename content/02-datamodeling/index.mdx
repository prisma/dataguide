## Overview

A crash course in (relational, although not ignoring others) designing data models. Parts are published as they're written, and concentrating first on situating databases and data modeling problems in an organization and systems design context, as well as covering some of the less-prominent areas of database functionality. Published in partnership with [Dian Fay](https://twitter.com/dianmfay?lang=en).
