## Introduction

When using [MongoDB](/intro/database-glossary#mongodb), you have the ability to be flexible with the structure of your data. You are not locked into maintaining a certain [schema](/intro/database-glossary#schema) that all of your [documents](/intro/database-glossary#document) must fit into. For any given field in a document, you are able to use any of the available [*data types*](/intro/database-glossary#data-type) supported by MongoDB. Despite this default way of working, you are able to impose a [JSON Schema](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/) in MongoDB to add validation on your collections if desired. We won't go into the details of schema design in this guide, but it can have an effect on data typing if implemented.

Data types specify a general pattern for the data they accept and store. It is paramount to understand when to choose a certain data type over another when planning your database. The type chosen is going to dictate how you're able to operate on your data and how it is stored. 

## JSON and BSON

Before getting into the details of specific data types, it is important to have an understanding of how MongoDB stores data. MongoDB and many other [document-based NoSQL databases](/intro/database-glossary#document-database) use [JSON](https://www.mongodb.com/json-and-bson)  (JavaScript Object Notation) to represent data records as [documents](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/mongodb/managing-documents). 

There are many advantages to using JSON to store data. Some of them being:

* easiness to read, learn, and its familiarity among developers
* flexibility in format, whether sparse, hierarchical, or deeply nested
* self-describing, which allows for applications to easily operate with JSON data
* allows for the focus on a minimal number of basic types 

JSON supports all the basic data types like string, number, boolean, etc. MongoDB actually stores data records as Binary-encoded JSON ([BSON](https://bsonspec.org/)) documents. Like JSON, BSON supports the embedding of documents and arrays within other documents and arrays. BSON allows for additional data types that are not available to JSON. 

## What are the data types in MongoDB?

Before going into detail, let's take a broad view of what data types are supported in MongoDB.

MongoDB supports a range of data types suitable for various types of both simple and complex data. These include:

Text

* `String`

Numeric

* `32-Bit Integer`
* `64-Bit Integer`
* `Double`
* `Decimal128`

Date/Time

* `Date`
* `Timestamp`

Other

* `Object`
* `Array`
* `Binary Data`
* `ObjectId`
* `Boolean`
* `Null`
* `Regular Expression`
* `JavaScript`
* `Min Key`
* `Max Key`

In MongoDB, each BSON type has both an integer and string identifiers. We'll cover the most common of these in more depth throughout this guide.

With MongoDB's document model, you are able to store data in embedded documents. Check out how you can find, create, update, and delete [composite types with the Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/composite-types), and model your data by [defining fields in your Prisma Schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-fields). 

</PrismaOutlinks>

## String types

The string type is the most commonly used MongoDB data type. Any value written inside of double quotes `""` in JSON is a string value. Any value that you want to be stored as text is going to be best typed as a `String`. BSON strings are UTF-8 and are represented in MongoDB as:

```
|       Type         | Number |  Alias   |
| ------------------ | ------ | -------- |
|      String        |    2   | "string" |
```

Generally, drivers for programming languages will convert from the language's string format to UTF-8 when serializing and deserializing BSON. This makes BSON an attractive method for storing international characters with ease for example. 

Inserting a document with a `String` data type will look something like this:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.insertOne({first_name: "Alex"})
{
		"acknowledged": true,
		"insertedId": ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d15")
}
```

Querying the collection will return the following:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find().pretty()
{
		_id: ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d15"), 
		first_name: "Alex"
}
```

### Using the `$type` operator

Before moving on to our next data type, it is important to know how you can type check the value before making any insertions. We'll use the previous example to demonstrate using the [`$type`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/type/) operator in MongoDB.

Let's say it has been awhile since we worked with the `mytestcoll` collection from before. We want to insert some additional documents into the collection with the `first_name` field. To check that we used `String` as the data type stored as a value of `first_name` originally, we can run the following using either the alias or number value of the data type:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find( { "first_name": { $type: "string" } } )
```

Or

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find( { "first_name": { $type: 2 } } )
```

Both queries return an output of all documents that have a `String` value stored for `first_name` from our previous section's insertion:

```shell
[ { _id: ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d15"), first_name: "Alex" } ]
```

If you query for a type that is not stored in the `first_name` field of any document, you will get no result. This indicates that it is another data type stored in `first_name`.

You are also able to query for multiple data types at a time with the `$type` operator like the following:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find( { "first_name": { $type: ["string", "null"] } } )
```

Because we did not insert any `Null` type values into our collection, the result will be the same:

```shell
[ { _id: ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d15"), first_name: "Alex" } ]
```

You can use the same method with all of the following types that we will discuss.



## Numbers and numeric values

MongoDB includes a range of numeric data types suitable for different scenarios. Deciding which type to use depends on the nature of the values you plan to store and your use cases for the data. JSON calls anything with numbers a *Number*. That forces the system to figure out how to turn it into the nearest native data type. We'll start off by exploring integers and how they work in MongoDB.

### Integer

The `Integer` data type is used to store numbers as whole numbers without any fractions or decimals. Integers can either be positive or negative values. There are two types in MongoDB, `32-Bit Integer` and `64-Bit Integer`. They can be represented in the two ways depicted in the table below, `number` and `alias`:

```
| Integer type   | number |    alias     | 
| ------------   | -----  | ------------ | 
|`32-bit integer`|   16   |    "int"     |
|`64-bit integer`|   18   |    "long"    |
```

The ranges a value can fit into for each type are the following:

```
| Integer type   |    Applicable signed range     |    Applicable unsigned range    |
| ------------   | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
|`32-bit integer`| -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647|  0 to 4,294,967,295             |
|`64-bit integer`| -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to  |  0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 
                        9,223,372,036,854,775,807
```

The types above are limited by their valid range. Any value outside of the range will result in an error. Inserting an `Integer` type into MongoDB will look like the below:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.insertOne({age: 26})
{
		"acknowledged": true,
		"insertedId": ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d14")
}
```

And finding the result will return the following:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find().pretty()
{
		_id: ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d14"), age: 26
}
```

As suggested by the names, a `32-Bit Integer` has 32 bits of integer precision which is useful for smaller integer values that you do not want to store as a sequence of digits. When growing in number size, you are able to bump up to the `64-Bit Integer` which has 64 bits of integer precision and fits the same use case as the former.

### Double

In BSON, the default replacement for JSON's *Number* is the `Double` data type. The `Double` data type is used to store a floating-point value and can be represented in MongoDB like so: 

```
|       Type         | Number |   Alias  |
| ------------------ | ------ | -------- |
|      Double        |    1   | "double" |
```

Floating point numbers are another way to express decimal numbers, but without exact, consistent precision. 

Floating point numbers can work with a large number of decimals efficiently but not always exactly. The following is an example of entering a document with the `Double` type into your collection:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.insertOne({testScore: 89.6})
{
		"acknowledged": true,
		"insertedId": ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d13")
}
```

There can be slight differences between input and output when calculating with doubles that could potentially lead to unexpected behavior. When performing operations that require exact values MongoDB has a more precise type. 

### Decimal128

If you are working with very large numbers with lots of floating point range, then the [`Decimal128`](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/quickstart/bson-data-types-decimal128/) BSON data type will be the best option. This will be the most useful type for values that require a lot of precision like in use cases involving exact monetary operations. The `Decimal128` type is represented as:

```
|       Type         | Number |   Alias   |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------- |
|     Decimal128     |   19   | "decimal" |
```

The BSON type, `Decimal128`, provides 128 bits of decimal representation for storing numbers where rounding decimals exactly is important. `Decimal128` supports 34 decimal digits of precision, or a [sinificand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significand) with a range of -6143 to +6144. This allows for a high amount of precision.

Inserting a value using the `Decimal128` data type requires using the [`NumberDecimal()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/shell-types/#std-label-shell-type-decimal) constructor with your number as a `String` to keep MongoDB from using the default numeric type, `Double`. 

Here, we demonstrate this:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.insertOne({price : NumberDecimal("5.099")})
{
		"acknowledged": true,
		"insertedId": ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d12")
}
```

When querying the collection, you then get the following return:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find().pretty()
{
		_id: ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d12"), 
		price: "5.099" 
}
```

The numeric value maintains its precision allowing for exact operations. To demonstrate the `Decimal128` type versus the `Double`, we can go through the following exercise.



### How precision can be lost based on data type

Say we want to insert a number with many decimal values as a `Double` into MongoDB with the following:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.insertOne({ price: 9999999.4999999999 })
{
		"acknowledged": true,
		"insertedId": ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d24")
}
```

When we query for this data, we get the following result:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find().pretty()
{
		_id: ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d24"), 
		price: 9999999.5
}
```

This value rounds up to `9999999.5`, losing its exact value that we inputted it with. This makes `Double` ill-suited for storage of numbers with many decimals.

The next example demonstrates where precision will get lost when passing a `Double` implicitly with `Decimal128` instead of a `String` like in the previous example.

We start by inserting the following `Double` again but with `NumberDecimal()` to make it a `Decimal128` type:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.insertOne({ price: NumberDecimal( 9999999.4999999999 ) })
{
		"acknowledged": true,
		"insertedId": ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d14")
}
```

**Note**: When making this insertion in the MongoDB shell, the following warning message is displayed:

```
Warning: NumberDecimal: specifying a number as argument is deprecated and may lead to 
loss of precision, pass a string instead
```

This warning message indicates that the number you are trying to pass could be subject to a loss of precision. They suggest to use a `String` using `NumberDecimal()`  so that you do not lose any precision. 

If we ignore the warning and insert the document anyways, the loss of precision is seen in the query results from the rounding up of the value:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find().pretty()
{
		_id: ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d14"), 
		price: Decimal128("9999999.50000000")
}
```

If we follow the recommended `NumberDecimal()` approach using a `String` we'll see the following results with maintained precision:

```
db.mytestcoll.insertOne({ price: NumberDecimal( "9999999.4999999999" ) } )
```

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find().pretty()
{
		_id: ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d14"), 
		price: Decimal128("9999999.4999999999")
}
```

For any use case requiring precise, exact values, this return could cause issues. Any work involving monetary operations is an example where precision is going to be extremely important and having exact values is critical to accurate calculations. This demonstration highlights the importance of knowing which numeric data type is going to be best suited for your data.



## Date

The BSON `Date` data type is a 64-bit integer that represents the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (Jan 1, 1970). This data type stores the current date or time and can be returned as either a date object or as a string. `Date` is represented in MongoDB as follows:

```
|       Type         | Number |     Alias    |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------ |
|       Date         |    9   |     "date"   |
```

**Note**: BSON `Date` type is signed. Negative values represent dates before 1970.



There are three methods for returning date values. 

1. `Date()` - returns a string 

2. `new Date()` - returns a date object using the `ISODate()` wrapper

3. `ISODate()` - also returns a date object using the `ISODate()` wrapper

We demonstrate these options below:

```shell
var date1 = Date()
var date2 = new Date()
var date3 = ISODate()

db.mytestcoll.insertOne({firstDate: date1, secondDate: date2, thirdDate: date3})
{
		"acknowledged": true,
		"insertedId": ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d22")
}
```

And when returning:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find().pretty()
{
				"_id" : ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d22"),
 				firstDate: 'Tue Sep 28 2021 11:28:52 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)',
   				secondDate: ISODate("2021-09-28T09:29:01.924Z"),
    			thirdDate: ISODate("2021-09-28T09:29:12.151Z")
}
```



## Timestamp

There is also the `Timestamp` data type in MongoDB for representing time. However, `Timestamp` is going to be most useful for internal use and ***is not*** associated with the `Date` type. The type itself is a sequence of characters used to describe the date and time when an event occurs. `Timestamp` is a 64 bit value where:

* the most significant 32 bits are `time_t` value (seconds since Unix epoch)
* the least significant 32 bits are an incrementing `ordinal` for operations within a given second

Its representation in MongoDB will look as follows:

```
|       Type         | Number |     Alias    |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------ |
|     Timestamp      |   17   |  "timestamp" |
```

When inserting a document that contains top-level fields with empty timestamps, MongoDB will replace the empty timestamp value with the current timestamp value. The exception to this is if the `_id` field contains an empty timestamp. The timestamp value will always be inserted as is and not replaced. 

Inserting a new `Timestamp` value in MongoDB will use the `new Timestamp()` function and look something like this:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.insertOne( {ts: new Timestamp() });
{
		"acknowledged": true,
		"insertedId": ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d23")
}
```

When querying the collection, you'll return a result resembling:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find().pretty()
{
		"_id" : ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d24"), 
		"ts" : Timestamp( { t: 1412180887, i: 1 })
}
```



## Object

The `Object` data type in MongoDB is used for storing embedded documents. An embedded document is a series of nested documents in ``key: value`` pair format. We demonstrate the `Object` type below:

```shell
var classGrades = {"Physics": 88, "German": 92, "LitTheoery": 79}

db.mytestcoll.insertOne({student_name: "John Smith", report_card: classGrades})
{
		"acknowledged": true,
		"insertedId": ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d18")
}

```

We can then view our new document:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find().pretty()
{
	_id: ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d18"),
	student_name: 'John Smith',
	report_card: {Physics: 88, German: 92, LitTheoery: 79}
}
```

The `Object` data type optimizes for storing data that is best accessed together. It provides some efficiencies around storage, speed, and durability as opposed to storing each class mark, from the above example, separately.



## Binary data

The `Binary data`, or `BinData`, data type does exactly what its name implies and stores binary data for a field's value. `BinData` is best used when you are storing and searching data, because of its efficiency in representing bit arrays. This data type can be represented in the following ways:

```
|       Type         | Number |     Alias    |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------ |
|     Binary data    |    5   |   "binData"  |
```

Here is an example of adding some `Binary data` into a document in a collection:

```shell
var data = BinData(1, "111010110111100110100010101")
db.mytestcoll.insertOne({binaryData: data})
{
		"acknowledged": true,
		"insertedId": ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d20")
}
```

To then see the resulting document:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find().pretty()
{
		"_id" : ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d20"),
		"binaryData" : BinData(1, "111010110111100110100010101")
}
```



## ObjectId

The `ObjectId` type is specific to MongoDB and it stores the document's unique ID. MongoDB provides an `_id` field for every document. ObjectId is 12 bytes in size and can be represented as follows:

```
|       Type         | Number |     Alias    |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------ |
|     ObjectId       |    7   |   "objectId" |
```

ObjectId consists of three parts that make up its 12-byte makeup:

* a 4-byte *timestamp value*, representing the ObjectId's creation, measured in seconds since the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)
* a 5-byte *random value*
* a 3-byte *incrementing counter* initialized to a random value

In MongoDB, each document within a collection requires a unique `_id` to act as a primary key. If the `_id` field is left empty for an inserted document, MongoDB will automatically generate an ObjectId for the field.

There are several benefits to using ObjectIds for the `_id`:

* in [`mongosh`](https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongosh) (MongoDB shell), the creation time of the `ObjectId` is accessible using the [`ObjectId.getTimestamp()`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId.getTimestamp/#mongodb-method-ObjectId.getTimestamp) method.
* sorting on an `_id` field that stores `ObjectId` data types is a close equivalent to sorting by creation time.

We've seen ObjectIds throughout the examples so far, and they will look similar to this:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find().pretty()
{ 
		_id: ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d19")
}
```



**Note**: ObjectId values should increase over time, however they are not necessarily monotonic. This is because they:

* Only contain one second of temporal resolution, so values created within the same second do not have guaranteed ordering
* values are generated by clients, which may have differing system clocks



## Boolean

MongoDB has the native `Boolean` data type for storing true and false values within a collection. `Boolean` in MongoDB can be represented as follows:

```
|       Type         | Number |     Alias    |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------ |
|      Boolean       |    8   |     "bool"   |
```

Inserting a document with a `Boolean` data type will look something like the following:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.insertOne({isCorrect: true, isIncorrect: false})
{
		"acknowledged": true,
		"insertedId": ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d21")
}
```

Then when searching for the document the result will appear as:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find().pretty()
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d21")
	"isCorrect" : true,
	"isIncorrect" : false
}
```



## Regular Expression

The `Regular Expression` data type in MongoDB allows for the storage of regular expressions as the value of a field. MongoDB uses [PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expression)](https://www.pcre.org/) as its regular expression language.

Its can be represented in the following way:

```
|       Type         | Number |  Alias  |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------- |
| Regular Expression |   11   | "regex" |
```

BSON allows you to avoid the typical "convert from string" step that is commonly experienced when working with regular expressions and databases. This type is going to be most useful when you are writing database objects that require validation patterns or matching triggers. 

For instance, you can insert the `Regular Expression` data type like this:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.insertOne({exampleregex: /tt/})
{
		"acknowledged": true,
		"insertedId": ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d16")
}
db.mytestcoll.insertOne({exampleregext:/t+/})
{
		"acknowledged": true,
		"insertedId": ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d17")
}
```

This sequence of statements will add these documents to your collection. You are then able to query your collection to find the inserted documents:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.find().pretty()
{
		_id: ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d16"), exampleregex: /tt/,
		_id: ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d17"), exampleregex: /t+/ 
}
```

The regular expression patterns are stored as regex and not as strings. This allows you to query for a particular string and get returned documents that have a regular expression matching the desired string.



## JavaScript (without scope)

Much like the previously mentioned `Regular Expression` data type, BSON allows for MongoDB to store JavaScript functions without scope as their own type. The `JavaScript` type can be recognized as follows:

```
|       Type         | Number |     Alias    |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------ |
|     JavaScript     |   13   | "javascript" |
```

Adding a document to your collection with the `JavaScript` data type will look something like this:

```shell
db.mytestcoll.insertOne({jsCode: "function(){var x; x=1}"})
{
		"acknowledged": true,
		"insertedId": ObjectId("614b37296a124db40ae74d122")
}
```

This functionality allows you to store JavaScript functions inside of your MongoDB collections if needed for a particular use case.

**Note**: With [MongoDB version 4.4](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.4-compatibility/#remove-support-for-bson-type-javascript-code-with-scope) and above, an alternative JavaScript type, the `JavaScript with Scope` data type, has been deprecated



## Conclusion

In this article, we've covered most of the common data types that are useful when working with MongoDB databases. There are [additional types](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/) that are not explicitly covered in this guide that may be helpful depending on the use case. Getting started by knowing these types covers most use cases. It is a strong foundation to begin modelling your MongoDB database.

It is important to know what data types are available to you when using a database so that you're using valid values and operating on the data with expected results. There are risks you can run into without properly typing your data like demonstrated in the `Double` versus `Decimal128` exercise. It's important to think about this ahead of committing to any given type.

## FAQ

<details><summary>Can you store regular expression patterns in MongoDB?</summary>

Yes, MongoDB allows for the storage of regular expression with the [`Regular Expression` data type](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/mongodb/mongodb-datatypes#regular-expression).

For instance, you can insert the `Regular Expression` data type like this:

```sql

<details><summary>How are dates represented as a data type in MongoDB?</summary>

[BSON Date](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/#std-label-document-bson-type-date) is a 64-bit integer that represents the number of milliseconds since the [Unix Epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

There are three methods for returning date values.

`Date()` - returns a string

`new Date()` - returns a date object using the ISODate() wrapper

`ISODate()` - also returns a date object using the ISODate() wrapper

The [returned data's display](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/mongodb/mongodb-datatypes#date) depends on which method it is stored.

<details><summary>How does MongoDB store images?</summary>

For images less than 16MB in size, MongoDB can store images using the [`BinData`](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/mongodb/mongodb-datatypes#binary-data) data type.

For images greater than 16MB, MongoDB recommends using [GridFS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/#when-to-use-gridfs) for storing in your database.
