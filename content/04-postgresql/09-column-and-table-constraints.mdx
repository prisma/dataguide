## Introduction

Constraints are *additional* requirements for acceptable values in addition to those provided by [data types](/postgresql/introduction-to-data-types).  They allow you to define narrower conditions for your data than those found in the general purpose data types.

These are often reflections on the specific characteristics of a field based on additional context provided by your applications.  For example, an `age` field might use the `int` data type to store whole numbers.  However, certain ranges of acceptable integers do not make sense as valid ages.  For instance, negative integers would not be reasonable in this scenario.  We can express this logical requirement in PostgreSQL using constraints.

## Where constraints are defined: column vs table constraints

Postgres allows you to create constraints associated with a specific column or with a table in general.

Almost all constraints can be used in both forms without modification:

Constraint  | Column | Table
----------  | ------ | -----
CHECK       | Yes    | Yes
NOT NULL    | Yes    | No*
UNIQUE      | Yes    | Yes
PRIMARY KEY | Yes    | Yes
FOREIGN KEY | Yes    | Yes

*: `NOT NULL` cannot be used as a table constraint.  However, you can approximate the results by using `IS NOT NULL` as the statement within a `CHECK` table constraint.

Let's look at how column and table constraints differ.

### Column constraints

**Column constraints** are constraints attached to a single column.  They are used to determine whether a proposed value for a column is valid or not.  Column constraints are evaluated after the input is validated against basic type requirements (like making sure a value is a whole number for `int` columns).

Column constraints are great for expressing requirements that are limited to a single field.  They attach the constraint condition directly to the column involved.  For instance, we could model the `age` restriction in a `person` table by adding a constraint after the column name and data type:

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
    . . .
    age int CHECK (age >= 0),
    . . .
);
```

This snippet defines a `person` table with one of the columns being an `int` called `age`.  The `age` must be greater than or equal to zero.  Column constraints are easy to understand because they are added as additional requirements onto the column they affect.

### Table constraints

The other type of constraint is called a **table constraint**.  Table constraints can express any restrictions that a column constraint can, but can additionally express restrictions that involve more than one column.  Instead of being attached to a specific column, table constraints are defined as a separate component of the table and can reference any of the table's columns.

The column constraint we saw earlier could be expressed as a table constraint like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
    . . .
    age int,
    . . .
    CHECK (age >= 0)
);
```

The same basic syntax is used, but the constraint is listed separately.  To take advantage of the ability for table constraints to introduce compound restrictions, we can use the logical `AND` operator to join multiple conditions from different columns.

For example, in a banking database, a table called `qualified_borrowers` might need to check whether individuals have an existing account and the ability to offer collateral in order to qualify for a loan.  It might make sense to include both of these in the same check:

```sql
CREATE TABLE qualified_borrowers (
    . . .
    account_number int,
    acceptable_collateral boolean,
    . . .
    CHECK (account_number IS NOT NULL AND acceptable_collateral = 't')
);
```

Here, we use the `CHECK` constraint again to check that the `account_number` is not null and that the loan officer has marked the client as having acceptable collateral by checking the `acceptable_collateral` column.  A table constraint is necessary since multiple columns are being checked.

## Creating names for constraints

When you create constraints using the syntax above, PostgreSQL automatically chooses a reasonable, but vague, name.  In the case of the `qualified_borrowers` table above, Postgres would name the constraint `qualified_borrowers_check`:

```sql
INSERT INTO qualified_borrowers VALUES (123, false);
```
```
ERROR:  new row for relation "qualified_borrowers" violates check constraint "qualified_borrowers_check"
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (123, f).
```

This name gives you information about the table and type of constraint when a constraint is violated.  In cases where multiple constraints are present on a table, however, more descriptive names are helpful to help troubleshooting.

You can optionally specify the name for your constraints by preceding the constraint definition with the `CONSTRAINT` keyword followed by the name.

For example, if you wanted to name the constraint in the `qualified_borrowers`  table `loan_worthiness`, you could instead define the table like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE qualified_borrowers (
    . . .
    account_number int,
    acceptable_collateral boolean,
    . . .
    CONSTRAINT loan_worthiness CHECK (account_number IS NOT NULL AND acceptable_collateral = 't')
);
```

Now, when we violate a constraint, we get our more descriptive label:

```sql
INSERT INTO qualified_borrowers VALUES (123, false);
```
```
ERROR:  new row for relation "qualified_borrowers" violates check constraint "loan_worthiness"
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (123, f).
```

You can name column constraints in the same way:

```sql
CREATE TABLE teenagers (
    . . .
    age int CONSTRAINT is_teenager CHECK (age >= 13 AND age <= 19),
    . . .
);
```

## PostgreSQL's list of available constraints

Now that we've covered some of the basics of how constraints work, we can take a deeper look at what constraints are available and how they may be used.

### Check constraints

**Check** constraints are a general purpose constraint that allows you to specify an expression involving column or table values that evaluates to a boolean.

You've already seen a few examples of check constraints earlier.  Check constraints begin with the keyword `CHECK` and then provide an expression enclosed in parentheses.  For column constraints, this is placed after the data type declaration.  For table constraints, these can be placed anywhere after the columns that they interact with are defined.

For example, we can create a `film_nominations` table that contains films that have been nominated and are eligible for a feature length award for 2019:

```sql
CREATE TABLE film_nominations (
    title text,
    director text,
    release_date date CHECK ('01-01-2019' <= release_date AND release_date <= '12-31-2019'),
    length int,
    votes int,
    CHECK (votes >= 10 AND length >= 40)
);
```

We have one column check restraint that checks that the `release_date` is within 2019.  Afterwards, we have a table check constraint ensuring that the film has received enough votes to be nominated and that the length qualifies it for the "feature length" category.

When evaluating check constraints, acceptable values return *true*.  If the new record's values satisfy all type requirements and constraints, the record will be added to the table:

```sql
INSERT INTO film_nominations VALUES (
    'A great film',
    'Talented director',
    '07-16-2019',
    117,
    45
);
```
```
INSERT 0 1
```

Values that yield *false* produce an error indicating that the constraint was not satisfied:

```sql
INSERT INTO film_nominations VALUES (
    'A poor film',
    'Misguided director',
    '10-24-2019',
    128,
    1
);
```
```
ERROR:  new row for relation "film_nominations" violates check constraint "film_nominations_check"
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (A poor film, Misguided director, 2019-07-16, 128, 1).
```

In this case, the film has satisfied every condition except for the number of votes required.  PostgreSQL rejects the submission since it does not pass the final table check constraint.

### Not null constraints

The `NOT NULL` constraint is much more focused.  It guarantees that values within a column are not null.  While this is a simple constraint, it is used very frequently.

To mark a column as requiring a non-null value, add `NOT NULL` after the type declaration:

```sql
CREATE TABLE national_capitals (
    country text NOT NULL,
    capital text NOT NULL,
);
```

In the above example, we have a simple two column table mapping countries to their national capitals.  Since both of these are required fields that would not make sense to leave blank, we add the `NOT NULL` constraint.

Inserting a null value now results in an error:

```sql
INSERT INTO national_capitals VALUES (
    NULL,
    'London',
);
```
```
ERROR:  null value in column "country" violates not-null constraint
DETAIL:  Failing row contains (null, London).
```

The `NOT NULL` constraint functions only as a column constraint (it cannot be used as a table constraint).  However, you can easily work around this by using `IS NOT NULL` within a table `CHECK` constraint.

For example, this offers equivalent guarantees using a table constraint:

```sql
CREATE TABLE national_capitals (
    country text,
    capital text,
    CHECK (country IS NOT NULL AND capital IS NOT NULL)
);
```

<PrismaOutlinks>

When working with Prisma Client, you can control whether each field is [optional or mandatory](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-model#optional-and-mandatory-fields) to get equivalent functionality to the `NOT NULL` constraint in PostgreSQL.

</PrismaOutlinks>

### Unique constraints

The `UNIQUE` constraint tells PostgreSQL that each value within a column must not be repeated.  This is useful in many different scenarios where having the same value in multiple records should be impossible.

For example, columns that deals with IDs of any kind should, by definition, have unique values.  A social security number, a student or customer ID, or a product UPC (barcode number) would be useless if they were not able to differentiate between specific people or items.

A `UNIQUE` constraint can be specified at the column level:

```sql
CREATE TABLE supplies (
    supply_id integer UNIQUE,
    name text,
    inventory integer
);
```

They can also be specified as table constraints:

```sql
CREATE TABLE supplies (
    supply_id integer,
    name text,
    inventory integer,
    UNIQUE (supply_id)
);
```

One of the advantages of using `UNIQUE` table constraints is that it allows you to perform uniqueness checks on a combination of columns.  This works by specifying two or more columns that PostgreSQL should evaluate together.  The values in individual columns may repeat but the combination of values specified must be unique.

As an example, let's look back at the `national_capitals` table we used before:

```sql
CREATE TABLE national_capitals (
    country text NOT NULL,
    capital text NOT NULL,
);
```

If we wanted to make sure that we don't add multiple records for the same pair, we could add `UNIQUE` constraints to the columns here:

```sql
CREATE TABLE national_capitals (
    country text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    capital text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
);
```

This would ensure that both the countries and capitals are only present once in each table.  However, [some countries have multiple capitals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_multiple_capitals).  This would mean we may have multiple entries with the same `country` value.  These wouldn't work with the current design:

```sql
INSERT INTO national_capitals VALUES (
    'Bolivia',
    'Sucre'
);
INSERT INTO national_capitals VALUES (
    'Bolivia',
    'La Paz'
);
```
```
INSERT 0 1
ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "national_capitals_country_key"
DETAIL:  Key (country)=(Bolivia) already exists.
```

If we still want to make sure we don't end up with duplicate entries while allowing for repeated values in individual columns, a unique check on the combination of `country` and `capital` would suffice:

```sql
CREATE TABLE national_capitals (
    country text,
    captial text,
    UNIQUE (country, capital)
);
```

Now, we can add both of Bolivia's capitals to the table without an error:

```sql
INSERT INTO national_capitals VALUES (
    'Bolivia',
    'Sucre'
);
INSERT INTO national_capitals VALUES (
    'Bolivia',
    'La Paz'
);
```
```
INSERT 0 1
INSERT 0 1
```

However, attempting to add the same combination twice is still caught by the constraint:

```sql
INSERT INTO national_capitals VALUES (
    'Bolivia',
    'Sucre'
);
INSERT INTO national_capitals VALUES (
    'Bolivia',
    'Sucre'
);
```
```
INSERT 0 1
ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "national_capitals_country_capital_key"
DETAIL:  Key (country, capital)=(Bolivia, Sucre) already exists.
```

### Primary key constraints

The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint serves a special purpose.  It indicates that the column can be used to uniquely identify a record within the table.  This means that it must be reliably unique and that every record must have a value in that column.

Primary keys are recommended for every table not required, and every table may only have one primary key.  Primary keys are mainly used to identify, retrieve, modify, or delete individual records within a table.  They allow users and administrators to target the operation using an identifier that is guaranteed by PostgreSQL to match exactly one record.

Let's use the `supplies` table we saw before as an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE supplies (
    supply_id integer UNIQUE,
    name text,
    inventory integer
);
```

Here we've identified that the `supply_id` should be unique.  If we wanted to use this column as our primary key (guaranteeing uniqueness and a non-null value), we could simply change the `UNIQUE` constraint to `PRIMARY KEY`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE supplies (
    supply_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    name text,
    inventory integer
);
```

This way, if we needed to update the inventory amounts for a specific supply, we could target it using the primary key:

```sql
INSERT INTO supplies VALUES (
    38,
    'nails',
    5
);
UPDATE supplies set inventory = 10 WHERE supply_id = 38;
```
```
INSERT 0 1
UPDATE 1
```

While many tables use a single column as the primary key, it is also possible to create a primary key using a set of columns, as a table constraint.

The `national_capitals` table is a good candidate to demonstrate this.  If we wanted to create a primary key using the existing columns, we could replace the `UNIQUE` table constraint with `PRIMARY KEY`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE national_capitals (
    country text,
    captial text,
    PRIMARY KEY (country, capital)
);
```

### Foreign keys constraints

[**Foreign keys**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key) are columns within one table that reference column values within another table.  This is desirable and often necessary in a variety of scenarios where tables contain related data.  This ability for the database to easily connect and reference data stored in separate tables is one of the primary features of relational databases.

For example, you may have a `orders` table to track individual orders and a `customers` table to track contact info and information about your customers.  It makes sense to put this information separately since customers may have many orders.  However, it also makes sense to be able to easily link the records in these two tables to allow more complex operations.

Let's start by trying to model the `customers` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name text,
    last_name text,
    phone_number bigint,
);
```

This table is pretty simple.  It includes columns to store the parent's first name, last name, and phone number.  It also specifies an ID column that uses the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint.  The `serial` data type is used to automatically generate the next ID in the sequence if an ID is not specified.

For the `orders` table, we want to be able to specify information about individual orders.  One essential piece of data is what customer placed the order.  We can use a foreign key to link the order to the customer without duplicating information.  We do this with the `REFERENCES` constraint, which defines a foreign key relationship to a column in another table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date date,
    customer integer REFERENCES customers
);
```

Here, we are indicating that the `customer` column in the `orders` table has a foreign key relationship with the `customers` table.  Since we do not specify a specific column within the `customers` table, PostgreSQL assumes that we want to link to the primary key in the `customers` table: `customer_id`.

If we try to insert a value into the `orders` table that doesn't reference a valid customer, PostgreSQL will reject it:

```sql
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (
    100,
    '11-19-2019',
    300
);
```
```
ERROR:  insert or update on table "orders" violates foreign key constraint "orders_customer_fkey"
DETAIL:  Key (customer)=(300) is not present in table "customers".
```

If we add the customer first, our order will then be accepted by the system:

```sql
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (
    300,
    'Jill',
    'Smith',
    '5551235677'
);
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (
    100,
    '11-19-2019',
    300
);
```
```
INSERT 0 1
INSERT 0 1
```

While the primary key is a great candidate for foreign keys because it guarantees to match only one record, you can also use other columns as long as they're unique.  To do so you just have to specify the column in parentheses after the table name in the `REFERENCES` definition:

```sql
CREATE TABLE example (
    . . .
    column type REFERENCES other_table (column)
);
```

You can also use sets of columns that are guaranteed unique.  To do so, you need to use a table constraint that begins with `FOREIGN KEY` and refers to columns you've defined earlier in the table description:

```sql
CREATE TABLE example (
    . . .
    FOREIGN KEY (column1, column2) REFERENCES other_table (column1, column2)
);
```

We cover how to define [relations](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations) in the Prisma schema in our documentation.

### Deciding what to do with foreign keys when deleting or updating

One consideration you'll need to think about when defining foreign key constraints is what to do when a referenced table is deleted or updated.

As an example, let's look at the `customers` and `orders` tables again.  We need to specify how we want the system to respond when we delete a customer from the `customers` table when the customer has an associated order in the `orders` table.

We can choose between the following options:

* **RESTRICT**: Choosing to restrict deletions means that PostgreSQL will refuse to delete the `customer` record if it's referenced by a record in the `orders` table.  To delete a customer, you will first have to remove any associated records from the `orders` table.  Only then will you be able to remove the value from the customer table.
* **CASCADE**: Selecting the cascade option means that when we delete the `customer` record, the records that reference it in the `orders` table are *also* deleted.  This is useful in many cases but must be used with care to avoid deleting data by mistake.
* **NO ACTION**: The no action option tells PostgreSQL to simply remove the customer and not do anything with the associated `orders` records.  If the constraint is checked later, it will still cause an error, but this won't happen during the initial deletion.  This is the default action if no other is specified.
* **SET NULL**: This option tells PostgreSQL to set the referencing columns to null when the referenced records are removed.  So if we delete a customer from the `customers` table, the `customer` column in the `orders` table will be set to `NULL`.
* **Set DEFAULT**: If this option is chosen, PostgreSQL will change the referencing column to the default value if the referenced record is deleted.  So if the `customer` column in the `orders` table had a default value and we remove a customer from the `customers` table, the record in the `orders` value would be assigned the default value.

These actions can be specified when defining a foreign key constraint by adding `ON DELETE` followed by the action.  So if we want to remove associated orders from our system when a customer is deleted, we could specify that like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date date,
    customer integer REFERENCES customers ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

These type of actions can also be applied when *updating* a referenced column instead of deleting one by using `ON UPDATE` instead of `ON DELETE`.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we learned about how PostgreSQL's constraints can be used to hone in on what specific values are valid for our tables.  We talked about the differences between column and table constraints.  Afterwards, we walked through the various types of constraints and demonstrated how to use them to restrict what types of input your tables accept.

Constraints are one of many features that help you define your expectations in your data structures.  Once you've provided constraints, you can then allow PostgreSQL to validate that any input matches the requirements.  This is one small way to use your database system to enforce guarantees so that your data remains consistent and meaningful.
